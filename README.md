# Blog-Website-
This is a blog website project I built while taking the App Breweryâ€™s Python &amp; Flask course on Udemy. It uses Flask for routing, Jinja2 for dynamic HTML templates, and Bootstrap for styling. I practiced rendering posts from a JSON API, creating multiple pages (Home, About, Contact), and using forms and templates effectively.
