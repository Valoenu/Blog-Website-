# Flask Blog Project

Hi! I'm a student currently learning software development through course by App Brewery on Udemy. This is one of the web development projects I built while studying Flask.

## ðŸ“š About the Project

This is a simple blog website built using:

- **Flask** (Python web framework)
- **Jinja2** (for HTML templating)
- **Bootstrap** (for responsive design)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**

The site includes:

- Homepage that displays a list of blog posts from an external JSON API
- Individual blog post pages using dynamic routing (`/post/<int:id>`)
- About and Contact pages with static content and a Bootstrap form
- Clean Blog template integration for a professional UI

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-blog.git
   cd flask-blog
